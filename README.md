# sensors

contains the source code (folders bellow) which helps you:

    t00: to turn on the LED, to run a UART with data processing, and in a loop to read one line from UART input and then to write it using UART output.
    
    t01: to get temperature, pressure and humidity from a BME280 sensor and to write them in a console every 10 seconds.
    
    t03: to read data from an accelerometer, a magnetometer and a gyroscope for getting a complete picture of the orientation of the device in space.
          (Work of the BMI160 sensor is based on the data from BMM150)
    
    t04: to measure the luminous flux (using a photodetector) per unit area and to write the data in the console every 10 seconds.
   

# HOW TO LAUNCH THE CODE:

# 1. You need to have
